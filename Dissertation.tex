   In this chapter, we first review some polyhedral decompositions and how these relate to generating functions for the lattice points of a polyhedra. 
   
\section{Working with generating functions: an example}
 
 Let us start with an easy example. Consider the one dimensional polyhedra in $\R$ given by $\PP = [0, n]$. We encode the latticd points of $\PP \cap \Z$ by placing each integer point as the power of a monomial, there by obtaining the polynomial $S(\PP; z) := z^0 + z + z^2 + z^3 + \cdots + z^n$. The polynomial $S(\PP; z)$ is called the \emph{generating function of $\PP$.} Notice that counting $\PP \cap \Z$ is equivalat to evaluating $S(\PP, 1)$.
 
 In terms of the computational complexity, listing each monomial in the polynomial $S(\PP, z)$ results in a polynomial with exponential length in the bit length of $n$. However, we can rewrite the summation with one term:
 
 \[ S(\PP, z) = z^0 + z^1 + \cdots + z^n = \frac{1-z^{n+1}}{1-z}.\]

Counting the number of point in $|\PP \cap \Z|$ is no longer as simple as evaluating $\frac{1-z^{n+1}}{1-z}$ at $z=1$ because this is a singularity. However, this singularity is removable. One could perform long-polynomial division, but this would result in a expoentially long polynomial in the bit length of $n$. Another option that yeilds a polynomail time algorithm would be to apply L'Hospital's rule:

\[\lim_{z \rightarrow 1} S(\PP, z) = \lim_{z \rightarrow 1} \frac{-(n+1)z^{n}}{1} = n+1. \]

Notice that $S(\PP, z)$ can be written in two ways:

\[ S(\PP, z) = \frac{1}{1-z} - \frac{z^{n+1}}{1-z} = \frac{1}{1-z} + \frac{z^n}{1-z^{-1}}.\]

The first two rational expressions have a nice description in terms of their series expansion:

\[ 1+z + \cdots + z^n = (z^0 + z^1 + \cdots ) -  (z^{n+1} + z^{n+2} + \cdots).\]

For the secont two rational functions, we have to be careful about the domain of convergence when computing the series expansion. Notice that in the series expansion,

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{1-z} =& \begin{cases} 
      z^0 + z^1 + z^2 \cdots & \;\;\;\;\; \text{ if } |z| < 1 \\
      -z^{-1} -z^{-2} - z^{-3} - \cdots & \;\;\;\;\; \text{ if }  |z| > 1 
   \end{cases} \\
\frac{z^n}{1-z^{-1}} =& \begin{cases} 
		-z^{n+1} - z^{n+2} - z^{n+3} -\cdots & \text{ if } |z| < 1 \\
      z^{n} + z^{n-1} + z^{n-2} + \cdots & \text{ if }  |z| > 1 
   \end{cases} \\
\end{align*}


adding the terms when $|z| <1$  or $|z| > 1$ results in the desired polynomial: $z^0 + z^1 + \cdots + z^n$. But we can also get the correct polynomial by adding the series that corresponds to different domains of convergence. However, to do this we must now add the series $\cdots + z^{-2} + z^{-1} + 0 + z + z^2 + \cdots$ which corresponds to the polyhedra that is the entire real line:
\begin{align*}
1 + z + \cdots z^n &= (1 + z + z^2 + \cdots)\\
& \quad  + (z^n + z^{n-1} + \cdots)  \\
& \quad - (\cdots + z^{-2} + z^{-1} + 0 + z + z^2 + \cdots)
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
1 + z + \cdots z^n &= (-z^{-1} -z^{-2} - z^{-3} - \cdots)\\
& \quad  + (-z^{n+1} - z^{n+2} - z^{n+3} -\cdots)  \\
& \quad + (\cdots + z^{-2} + z^{-1} + 0 + z + z^2 + \cdots)
\end{align*}

Hence by including the series $\cdots + z^{-2} + z^{-1} + 0 + z + z^2 + \cdots$, we can perform the series expansion of $\frac{1}{1-z} + \frac{z^n}{1-z^{-1}}$ by computing the series expansion of each term on potentially different domains of convergence. 

In the next sections, we will develop rigorous justification for adding the series  $\cdots + z^{-2} + z^{-1} + 0 + z + z^2 + \cdots$.
 
\section{Indicator functions}

\begin{definition} 
The indicator function, $[A]: \R^d \rightarrow \R$, of a set $A \subseteq \R^d$ takes two values: $[A](x) =1$ if $x \in A$ and $[A](x)=0$ otherwise. 
\end{definition} 

The set of indicator functions on $\R^d$ froms a vectorspace with pointwise additions and scalar multiplication. Notice that $[A]\cdot [B] = [A \cap B]$, and $[A]+[B] = [A \cup B] + [A \cap B]$. 

\begin{definition} The \emph{cone} of a set $A \subseteq \R^d$ is all conic combinations of the points from $A$:
\[\Cone(A) := \left\{ \sum_i \alpha_i a_i \mid a_i \in A, \alpha_i \in \R_{\geq 0} \right\} \]
\end{definition} 

\begin{definition} 
Let $\PP$ be a polyhedron and $x \in \PP$. Then the \emph{tangent cone}, of $\PP$ at $x$ is the polyhedral cone 
\[\TCone(\PP, x) := x + \Cone(\PP - x)\]  
\end{definition} 
 
Note that if $x$ is a vertex of $\PP$, and $\PP$ is given by an inequality description, then the tangent cone $\TCone(\PP, x)$ is the intersection of inequalities that are tight at $x$. Also, $\TCone(\PP, x)$ includes the affine hull of the face that $x$ is in, so the tangent cone is pointed only if $x$ is a vertex. 

When $F$ is a face of $\PP$, we will also use the notation $\TCone(\PP, F)$ to denote $\TCone(\PP, x)$ where $x$ is any interior point of $F$.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{brianchon1837}, \cite{gram1871}]
Let $\PP$ be a polyhedron, then 
\[[\PP] = \sum_{F} (-1)^{\dim(F)}[\TCone(\PP, F)] \]
where the sum ranges over all faces $F$ of $\PP$ including $F = \PP$ but excluding $F = \emptyset$
\end{theorem}
